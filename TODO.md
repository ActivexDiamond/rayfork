# Todo list

- Review error handling. Maybe make error checking functions for structs (eg: rf_image_is_valid(rf_image))
- Review all string literals, especially shaders and uniform names
- Make allocator macro that just wraps over a buffer (simple stack allocator)
- Check all `todo` and `note` comments 
- Update examples.
- Make (some) dependencies optional.
- Group functions and check their order.
- Rewrite readme and add documentation.
- Investigate `spacing` argument for `rf_draw_text` and other text functions.
- use new tinyobjloader with io callbacks.
- Rename everything from camelCase to snake_case.
- Add clang tidy maybe???
- Add a clang format file if that was a thing.
- Add individual build scripts or make files for every example.
- Add DDS, PKM, KTX, PVR, ASTC
